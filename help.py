# # import agents
# # print(dir(agents)) 
# This imports the agents module and prints a list of all names (functions, classes, variables) defined in that module. It's useful for discovering what's available when you're not sure about the module's contents or API structure.

# # from agents import Agent
# # help(Agent)
# This imports just the Agent class from the agents module, then displays comprehensive documentation for that class using Python's built-in help system. This shows you:

# The class hierarchy (inheritance)
# Available methods and their parameters
# Docstrings with usage information
# Required arguments for initialization
